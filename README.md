# Veterans Pest Control Website

This repository contains the source code for the official website of **Veterans Pest Control, LLC**.  

## Project Overview

Veterans Pest Control is a veteran‑owned business providing residential and commercial pest control services in Georgia and Alabama.  The website highlights the company’s unique value proposition—years of experience in pest management and a commitment to serving the community with integrity.  The site includes:

* A responsive design built with vanilla HTML and CSS.
* A hero section featuring a patriotic theme and a call to action.
* Sections for services, company background, and contact details.
* A simple contact form for visitors to request quotes or inspections.

Future work will include additional pages for specific services, blog posts on pest prevention, integration with a scheduling system, and improved styling using frameworks such as Tailwind or Bootstrap.
